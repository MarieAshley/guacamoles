## how to play
Run ch1.py

You start as a young child, full of enthusiasm and curiosity. As you investigate your world, you are transported into some else's memories. What could all of this mean?

To win, find and investigate whatâ€™s hidden in a flowery plain, a city, a dark forest, and under a willow tree. Return to the city when all items are found and investigated.

## history
This story is a celebration of my Dad (named Simon here).

My Dad, for the last few years, has been working on an algorithm to "find the question" (for Douglas Adams fans) given data. In other words, find the theory that supports the data. As the main character in this text based game investigates the world, he can discover and investigate various objects (data) and eventually discovers a relationship. Most objects are representations of the fibonacci sequence. Eventually, at the end our main character draws the connection, with the help of his crush, that what defines the heavens also defines the smallest and seemingly most insignificant items on earth.

The main character and his crush are a representation of my Dad and my Mom. 

Investigating an item transports the main character to the memories of my actual dad, where we experience some of his favorite memories of his wife and two daughters.

This was a gift to my Dad in 2016.
